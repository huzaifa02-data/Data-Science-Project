# Data-Science-Project
Here is the project of data science in which I collected the dataset from kaggle (mobile sales classification), then perform some operations over the dataset as follows.
**⭐ Project Overview:**
This project performs:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Data cleaning & preprocessing.
Feature engineering.
Correlation analysis.

**Model training using:**
Logistic Regression.
Decision Tree Classifier.
Linear Regression (if included for tests).
Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix.

**Libraries used:**
pandas, numpy — data manipulation.
matplotlib, seaborn — visualization.
sklearn — ML models & model evaluation.

**GUI Interface:**
The gui rar file upload of this project that shows the range of price as low,medium and high as (0,1,2) respectivily and user can easy manage their classification need of the mobile all in this gui and pridict the range of price as :
High - 1 laks plus.
Medium - Between 50 thousand to 1 lakh.
low - 50 thousand.

**📈 Results**
Successfully predicted mobile phone price categories.
Feature engineering improved classification.
Decision Tree generally performs better for non-linear features.
