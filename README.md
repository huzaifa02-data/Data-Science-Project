# Data-Science-Project
Here is the project of data science in which I collected the dataset from kaggle (mobile sales classification), then perform some operations over the dataset as follows.
**⭐ Project Overview:**
This project performs:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Data cleaning & preprocessing.
Feature engineering.
Correlation analysis.

**Model training using:**
Logistic Regression.
Decision Tree Classifier.
Linear Regression (if included for tests).
Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix.

**Libraries used:**
pandas, numpy — data manipulation.
matplotlib, seaborn — visualization.
sklearn — ML models & model evaluation.

**📈 Results**
Successfully predicted mobile phone price categories.
Feature engineering improved classification.
Decision Tree generally performs better for non-linear features.
